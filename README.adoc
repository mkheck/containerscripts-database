== Purpose

These are some scripts I use to create, configure, & run various databases on my local machine for live-coding sessions and for the databases chapter (Chapter 6 of my book, link:https://bit.ly/springbootbook[Spring Boot: Up and Running]).

WARNING: This should be obvious, but these scripts/configurations are *not* intended to be "enterprise grade" and as such, should *not* be used for production loads! Use them at your own risk. They work great for development and demos, though.

Here is the general order of things to set it up like I use it:

. Install Docker Desktop or similar container execution environment on your machine
. `git clone` this repo (or fork, then clone, etc.)
. Start your preferred container runtime
. Create the various images & start the associated containers (this must only be done once)
.. Run the `run<choose_your_database>.sh` script to create a local database image (of your choice) & run the container
.. To shut down after the initial run, simply use the appropriate "stop command" of your container runtime, e.g. `docker stop <my_container_name>`
. For subsequent startup/shutdown of these containers, simply run the corresponding "start command of your container runtime, e.g. `docker start <my_container_name>` & `docker stop <my_container_name` to start/stop

NOTE: For each of these databases, I map a container directory to an external directory to hold the persisted data. This is so the database isn't empty with subsequent database creation/startup cycles (upgrades, etc.) and so it can be backed up independently of the container(s). You will need to edit this path in the `run<choose_your_database>.sh` script for proper operation.
